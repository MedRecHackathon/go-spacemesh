## Liberthon Hackathon branch
Welcome to the Liberthon Hackathon tag built especially to provide you with P2P capabilities 

### <b>Quickstrat: Running Spacemesh P2P client</b>
You can deploy the P2P client in two ways:
- Compile spacemesh agent and run executable locally
- Build or use Spacemesh Docker image

### Using Spacemsh P2P
Whether you are running the agent via Docker or Executable, This is how you can communicate and use the agent to build a P2P network.

In order for us to setup a P2P network we must first boot up a bootstrap node, This node will be one of the first nodes any client will connect to and allow nodes to discover new nodes in the network. to boot up a bootstrap node use:
```
./spacemesh
```
After a bootstrap node has been created, the other nodes can be booted and configured to connect to it.
To specify a bootstrap when booting more nodes use the following command:

```
./go-spacemesh --bootstrap --bootnodes <BOOTSTRAP_IP>:<PORT<7513>>/<BOOTSTRAP_NODEID>
```
Note that you need to have the node ID in order to connect

## spacemesh P2P image

```
docker run spacemesh/spacemesh_p2p
```

you can expose RPC port 9090 to control from host or integrate you executable to the docker image itself

## Using the P2P framework
After setting up your enviorment you can communicate with the p2p agent to send and receive messages.

### Receiving messages
In order to receive messages from the agent, a UDP por can be opened for listening to new messages. To open a UDP port a register command must be sent to the agent in the following manner:
```
curl -X POST -d '{ "name":"anton", "port":8081 }' 127.0.0.1:9090/v1/register
```
* `name`: The P2P inner protocol uses a protocol name to distinguish between messages of diffrent protocols. 
* `port`: The port number on which data will be received (UDP) 

After registering your protocol, raw messages can be received on the port. <b>note:</b> the data received is binary and needs to be parsed by your app according to your protocol.

### Sending messages
Send a message to a specific P2P client
```
curl -X POST -d '{ "nodeID":"vx3xRTWPhSapZPB7oTCCD3J8hNrWzFmzQwnzut7BNLMV", "protocolName": "anton", "payload" : [0,10,10,10] }' 127.0.0.1:9090/v1/send
```
This call is similar to the brodcast call
- `nodeID`: ID of the receiver node 

### Broadcasting messages
Messages can be sent throughout the network thru the gossip network, to send a message use the following call:
```
curl -X POST -d '{ "protocolName": "anton", "payload" : [0,10,10,10] }' 127.0.0.1:9090/v1/broadcast
```
- `protocolName`: protocol name that will be sent, receiveing clients will route the message according to this name
- `payload`: the payload (in bytes) that contains your application specific data.

## go-spacemesh
üíæ‚è∞üí™
Thanks for your interest in this open source project. This is the go implementation of the [Spacemesh](https://spacemesh.io) p2p node. Spacemesh is a decentralized blockchain computer using a new race-free consensus protocol that doesn't involve energy-wasteful `proof of work`. We aim to create a secure and scalable decentralized computer formed by a large number of desktop PCs at home. We are designing and coding a modern blockchain platform from the ground up for scale, security and speed based on the learnings of the achievements and mistakes of previous projects in this space. 

To learn more about Spacemesh head over to our [wiki](https://github.com/MedRecHackathon/go-spacemesh/wiki).

### Motivation
SpacemeshOS is designed to create a decentralized blockchain smart contracts computer and a cryptocurrency that is formed by connecting the home PCs of people from around the world into one virtual computer without incurring massive energy waste and mining pools issues that are inherent in other blockchain computers, and provide a provably-secure and incentive-compatible smart contracts execution environment. Spacemesh OS is designed to be ASIC-resistant and in a way that doesn‚Äôt give an unfair advantage to rich parties who can afford setting up dedicated computers on the network. We achieve this by using a novel consensus protocol and optimize the software to be most effectively be used on home PCs that are also used for interactive apps. 

### What is this good for?
Provide dapp and app developers with a robust way to add value exchange and other value related features to their apps at scale. Our goal is to create a truly decentralized cryptocoin that fulfills the original vision behind bitcoin to become a secure trustless store of value as well as a transactional currency with extremely low transaction fees.

### Target Users
go-spacemesh is designed to be installed and operated on users' home PCs to form one decentralized computer.

### Project Status
Development is currently focused on 3 main node core components:
1. The p2p/networking - the project includes a modern and robust p2p protocol for use by components up the stack.
2. The POST/blockmesh based consensus layer - Spacemesh protocol implementation, utilizing the p2p capabilities.  
3. App scaffolding - supporting functionality such as config, repl, cli and cross platform packaging.

Over the last few months, we had good progress on #1 and #3 and we are now starting to focus on #2.

### Getting

install [Go 1.9.2 or later](https://golang.org/dl/) for your platform

```
go get github.com/MedRecHackathon/go-spacemesh
```
or
- Fork the project from https://github.com/MedRecHackathon/go-spacemesh 
- Checkout the `develop` branch of your fork from GitHub
- Move your fork from `$GOPATH/src/github.com/YOURACCOUNT/go-spacemesh` to `$GOPATH/src/github.com/MedRecHackathon/go-spacemesh`
This allows GO tools to work as expected.

### Building
To build `go-spacemesh` for your current system architecture use:

To build a binary for a specific architecture directory use:
```
make darwin | linux | windows
```
Platform-specific binaries are saved to the `/build` directory.

### Running
```
./go-spacemesh
```

### Testing
